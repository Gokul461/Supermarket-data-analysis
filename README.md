# 🛒 Supermarket Sales Data Analysis 📊

This project performs a basic foundational analysis of a supermarket sales dataset. The dataset (`sales_data.csv`) contains sales data for a supermarket, and the analysis is conducted using Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to extract insights and visualize the data.

## 📋 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the sales data from a supermarket to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. Using tools like **Pandas** for data manipulation, **NumPy** for numerical calculations, and **Matplotlib** for data visualization, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the supermarket's sales performance.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is a CSV file (`sales_data.csv`) that contains the following columns:
- `City`: The city of the product sold.
- `Location`: The Location of units sold.
- `Gender`: The gender of the customer in each location.
- `Total Sales`: The total sales amount for the product.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Steps

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values and handled them.
- Identified and corrected any inconsistencies in the data.
  
### 2. 📊 Data Exploration
- Explored basic statistics (mean, median, mode) of `Quantity Sold` and `Total Sales`.
- Analyzed sales distribution over time.
  
### 3. 💰 Sales Analysis
- Identified top-performing products based on sales volume and total revenue.
- Visualized sales trends over time using **Matplotlib**.

### 4. 💡 Insights
- Identified patterns in sales performance (e.g., seasonality, product trends).
- Provided recommendations for improving sales strategies based on the findings.

## ⚙️ Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
🏃 How to Run
